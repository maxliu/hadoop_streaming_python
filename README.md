# hadoop_streaming_python
This is a joint project with Alison Bo Wen (alisonbwen@gmail.com) for hadoop with python and R by using hadoop-streaming. Here is the python code and Alison is working on R code.

Since it is not very difficult for most of the tasks, we are trying to use streaming techenic only although there are some good wrappers available such as pydoop, mrjob for python and RHadoop for R.

There are some good resources from internet and we found the best is from Michael G. Noll.
